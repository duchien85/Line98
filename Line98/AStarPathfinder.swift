// NOTE FOR MYSELF
// These functions were previously implemented in Board thought PathFinderDataSource protocol
// And the AStarPathFinder constantly asked the board to calculate and provide this information
// On each step. But this was a bad decision: board as the main class should be independant.
// Except probably the cost should be sent as a parameter too.
// But in this game the cost is always the same so it doesnt matter
